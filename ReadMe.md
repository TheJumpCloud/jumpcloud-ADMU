### Who should use it?

The JumpCloud ADMU is designed for Active Directory or Azure AD migration scenarios, it can be utilized by admins who wish to migrate off AD or Azure AD and onto JumpCloud while keeping user profiles intact.

### What is it?

The JumpCloud Active Directory Migration Utility or ADMU is designed to convert Windows non-local user profiles to local profiles which can then be managed by JumpCloud.

### Why do I need it?

JumpCloud has the ability to sync and bind to Windows local accounts. However, in migration scenarios where the system is currently bound to active directory or Azure AD, the account can not be taken over. Instead, numerous steps must be taken to prepare and convert the target profile to a state which can be taken over and bound to JumpCloud. The JumpCloud Active Directory Migration Utility automates the otherwise tedious steps to convert AD/ Azure AD profiles to local profiles.
