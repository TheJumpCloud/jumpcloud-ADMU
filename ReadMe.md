The JumpCloud Active Directory Migration Utility (ADMU) is designed to migrate Active Directory or Azure Active Directory accounts to local account for subsequent JumpCloud takeover and management. Active Directory accounts on a system can not be directly taken over by the JumpCloud Agent. Those accounts must first be converted to a local account before the JumpCloud agent can take-over and manage that account on a given system. The ADMU aims to help admins automate the otherwise tedious process of account migration.

To see an example of an account migration, view the video demonstration below:
