## 2.0.0

Release Date: July 08, 2021

#### RELEASE NOTES

```
* Added API Key form and parameter to allow for "Auto-Binding" the user during Migration
    * If selected, both the API Key and Connect Key values must be entered
    * At the end of migration the ADMU will search the JumpCloud Organization for the username entered and bind the user to the system
* GUI runs of the ADMU should prompt to view the log after migration
* The migration user's registry hive is saved as a unique filename (ex: NTUSER_original.DAT is now NTUSER_original_yyyy-mm-dd-HHMMSS)
* The 2.0.0 version of the tool no longer includes the Microsoft User State Migration Tool. Priror versions of the tool should be used if it's necessary to copy data from one profile to another.
    * The default behavior of the 2.0.0 tool is to convert accounts with what was previously the `ConvertProfile` parameter.

```

#### FEATURES:

* Migration users may be automatically bound to systems post-successful migration
* If the ADMU fails to migrate a user, the tool will attempt to remove the newly created local user so that the tool can be run again.
  * This negates the need to manually remove the new local user if re-running the tool

#### IMPROVEMENTS:

* GUI version of the tool no longer queries account home directory size and should load much faster
* Option to Update Home Path has been removed from the GUI version of the tool
  * Often times changing the home path from "migration_user" to "migration.user" would break app functionality and cause more confusion than it was intended to solve. the `UpdateHomePath` parameter can still be set to true through the CLI/ PowerShell Module Version of the tool

#### BUG FIXES:

* Given the case where the ADMU writes a registry backup, subsequently fails, exits and is run again, The registry backup should not be overwritten with the same name.

## 1.6.6

Release Date: July 8, 2021

#### RELEASE NOTES

```
Added AzureAD leave domain check, if not running as NTAUTHORITY\SYSTEM popup will inform in gui related wiki article. 
```

#### IMPROVEMENTS:
```
Add logic to only run AzureAD leave domain command if running as NTAUTHORITY\SYSTEM. If not AzureAD joined, it will leave domain as normal.
If not run as SYSTEM, the GUI will stop the param being passed and a dialog shown. In the migration script an error will be logged and continue without running the leave domain command in the case of not being run as SYSTEM and AzureAD joined.
```

#### BUG FIXES:

Updated 'Accept EULA - more info' link to correct URL

## 1.6.5

Release Date: June 15, 2021

#### RELEASE NOTES

```
Updated automated testing framework and pipeline for ADMU, no changes to the migration tool since version 1.6.4
```

## 1.6.4

Release Date: June 14, 2021

#### RELEASE NOTES

```
Added ability to change the rename step in the profile home path step. This defaults to not renaming to better account for systems where the folder is in use or can't be renamed. Also helps with any applications hardcoded to previous home path.

```

#### IMPROVEMENTS:

```
Adds 'Update Home Path' paramater and checkbox
```

## 1.6.3

Release Date: April 13, 2021

#### RELEASE NOTES

```
Some remote agents or RMM tools may invoke commands as NT Authority\System. If the ADMU is remotely invoked with those tools and run as the  NT Authority\System account, previous versions of the ADMU would fail to migrate sucessfully. v1.6.3 addresses this and resets permissions of the blank profile so that NT Authority\System can delete the blank profile after it's NTUSER.DAT & UsrClass.dat files have been copied back to the user-to-migrate's profile.
```

#### IMPROVEMENTS:

Exit 1 (error) conditions explicitly defined when the tool fails to complete migration.

#### BUG FIXES:

Fixes a bug for some remote agent or RMM tools which would cause the ADMU tool to fail migration.

## 1.6.2

Release Date: March 29, 2021

#### RELEASE NOTES

```
Improve registry load, copy and unload steps.
```

#### IMPROVEMENTS:

Registry load, copy and unload steps have been streamlined. Before modifying a user's registry, the files are first checked to unsure they can be loaded and unloaded without error. After loading the profiles for modification the copy step will only modify the backup registry file. Once all modifications are complete, the registry files recognized by windows are renamed for backup and the backup files are renamed so windows recognizes those files on profile login. This should prevent profiles being left in a half-migrated state if some step in the process fails.

## 1.6.1

Release Date: March 16, 2021

#### RELEASE NOTES

```
Improve local user folder check for capitalization and other scenarios.

#### IMPROVEMENTS:

New local user initialization is streamlined and no longer relies on passing the user's temporary credentials.

## 1.5.0

Release Date: Dec 10, 2020
